{"page": 14, "content": "Recently, t he effectiveness of process goals during self -directed learning was compared with that of product \ngoals without any external social feedback. Zimmerman and Kit santas (1996) worked with high -school girls \nlearning the novel athletic skill of dart throwing. All of the girls in the experimental groups were given strategy \ntraining and then were asked to practice on their own. Some girls were asked to set a process goal and \nconcentrate on executing the strategy (e.g., sight ing, throwing, follow through) as they practiced the skill, \nwhereas others were asked to set a product (e.g., out come) goal of trying to get the most points as they \npracticed. The results showed that girls given a process goal surpassed those given a prod uct goal in dart -\nthrowing skill, self -efficacy beliefs, self -reactions (rated satisfaction), and intrinsic inter est in dart throwing \nrelative to other sports.  \n \nThese results suggest that as strategic performing is being internalized, process goals enhance learning better \nthan prod uct goals. However, after internalized self -control is attained, product goals may enhance learning \nbetter, and this hypothe sis was tested in research. Zimmerman and Kitsantas (1997) found that after a dart -\nthrowing strategy was fully internalized (i.e., the strategy was performed flawlessly), product goals were highly \neffective in guiding self -directed practice. High -school girls given product goals surpassed those given process \ngoals in dart -throwing accuracy, self -efficacy beli efs, self -evaluative reactions, and intrinsic motivation.  \n \nFUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS  \nThis article suggests that students' self -regulation of learn ing develops from initial social modeling experiences \nand progresses through increasing levels of self -directed func tioning. We have described some research results \nthat support the importance of modeling and self -efficacy in this formulation. More resear ch is necessary on the \nrole of models, as well as on the other social origins of verbal description, social guidance, and feedback. Most \nof the existing research has been done outside of the regular classroom context, so work is especially needed in \nactual  classrooms. In this section we suggest three areas where we believe future research is needed to clarify \nand refine the hypothesized operation of social origins of the devel opment of self -regulatory competence.  \n \nPeer -Assisted Learning  \nTeachers commonly make use of models in the classroom, but theory and research suggest that the particular \nuse of models who demonstrate the cognitive skills and strategies of self -regulation is important. Research \nshows that teachers who model strategies and verbalize their thought processes as they perform tasks can help \ndevelop self -regulatory competencies (Graham & Harris, 1989a, 1989b; Palincsar & Brown, 1984; Sawyer et \nal., 1992).  \n \nWe advocate greater research on the role of peer -assisted learning, whi ch takes many forms including tutoring, \nmentoring, cooperative groups, peer trainers, peer counseling, peer assessment, and reciprocal teaching. We \ndiscuss two of these: cooperative groups and peer trainers.  \n \nIn cooperative groups, a small number of students work jointly on a task that is structured so that each group \nmember has some responsibility (Cohen, 1994). Groups typically are arranged in such a fashion that each \nmember is required to master the skills a nd the group does not proceed until the skill is mastered. That students \nserve as models for one another is essential. For example, each student might work on some aspect of the task \nand then explain and demonstrate the skill to other group members after h e or she has mastered it. These  \npeer models teach skills and raise observers' self -efficacy for learning (Schunk, 1987).  \n \nMuch has been written on the benefits of cooperative groups for student learning and achievement beliefs. A \nwealth of research shows th eir effectiveness compared with more traditional forms of instruction (Johnson & \nJohnson, 1985; Slavin, 1983, 1995). Less is known, however, on how the various components of cooperative \narrangements exert their effects and on the extent that groups can hel p develop mem bers' self -regulatory skills.  \n \nResearch is needed on the dynamics of cooperative groups as they work on tasks requiring self -regulatory \nfunctions such as setting goals, planning and organizing tasks, monitoring and evaluating progress, and making "}
