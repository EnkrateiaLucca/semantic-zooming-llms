{"page": 3, "content": "behaviors at designated levels (Bandura, 1986, 1997), is an important cognitive mechanism that mediates the \nrelation of social (observational) influences and adaptive self-regulatory functioning (Schenk, 1994).  \n \nWe initially p resent a theoretical overview of self -regula tion from the particular perspective of social cognitive \ntheory. We focus on the roles played by two constructs that are intimately linked with this theoretical \nperspective and that  have been rigorously investigated by researchers in this tra dition\u2014modeling and self -\nefficacy. Although these con structs have been discussed in the context of other theories (Kopp, 1982; Paris & \nNewman, 1990), a unique contribution of social cognitive th eory is that it highlights their contribu tions by \nexplicating them in detail to include careful empirical research methods. We then describe a social cognitive \nphase model of the development of self -regulatory competence, and we compare that perspective t o some other \nprominent views relating to the development of self -regulation. Research on modeling and self -efficacy \nprocesses is summarized, and we conclude with suggestions for future research in educational settings.  \n \nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND  \nSocial Cogniti ve Theory of Self -Regulation  \nBandura's (1986) social cognitive theory views human func tioning as a series of reciprocal interactions between \nbehav ioral, environmental, and personal variables (e.g., cognitions, affects). For example, research shows that \nself-efficacy be liefs (personal variable) influence achievement behaviors (choice of tasks, effort, persistence) in \nthat efficacious stu dents are more likely to choose to engage in tasks, expend effort, and pers ist to overcome \nobstacles and succeed (Schunk, 1996a; Zimmerman, 1995b). Conversely, behaviors influence personal \nvariables. As students work on tasks (be havior) they mentally note their progress (personal variable), which \nconveys to them that they are ca pable of learning, thereby raising their self -efficacy (Schunk, 1989).  \n \nAn example of the influence of environment on behavior occurs when teachers introduce an unusual stimulus or \nnovel event (environmental variable) and students direct their atten tion toward it (behavior). Behavior can affect \nenvironment. For example, if students act puzzled by a teacher's explana tion (behavior), the teacher may reteach \nthe material (envi ronmental variable).  \n \nPersonal variables and environments also affect one an other. For example, when students with high self -\nefficacy find themselves trying to accomplish an academic task in an environment full of distractions (e.g., \nnoise, others working), they may redouble their mental concentration (personal vari able) to make the \nenvironment less distracting. Related views of self -regulation discuss this type of personal influence under the \nheadings of volitional control (Como & Kanfer, 1993) and proximal resource allocation (Kanfer & Ackerman, \n1989). The influence of environmental variables on personal vari ables is seen when teachers give students \nverbal feedback (environmental variable; e.g., \"That's right. You're really getting good at this.\"), which raises \ntheir self -efficacy\u2014a personal variable.  \n \nSocial cognitive theory postulates that the self -regulation process comprises three major levels (subprocesses): \nself-ob servation, self -judgment, and self -reaction (Bandura, 1986; Kanfer & Gaelick, 1986). Self-observation \nrefers to deliberate attention to  specific aspects of one's behavior (Bandura, 1986). Bandura and others (e.g., \nMace, Belfiore, & Shea, 1989) recommend assessing behaviors on dimensions such as quantity, quality, rate, \nand originality. When self -observation results in perceptions of goal progress, it can motivate one to improve \n(Schunk, 1989). Students with academic problems often are surprised to learn that they waste much valuable \nstudy time on nonacademic tasks. Such knowledge can moti vate students to improve their habits. Self -\nobserva tion is assisted with the use of self-recording, where instances of behavior are recorded along with their \ntime, place, and fre quency of occurrence (Mace et al., 1989).  \n \nSelf-observation is closely linked to self-judgment, which refers to comparing current performance with a \nstandard. Bandura (1986) places much emphasis on judgmental proc esses and on specifying factors affecting \njudgments, which has facilitated empirical investigation. Thus, self -judgments are hypothesized to be affected \nby type and importance of standards employed. Standards may be stated in absolute or normative terms. \nAbsolute standards are fixed (e.g., a student who attempts to finish an assignment during a class period), "}
