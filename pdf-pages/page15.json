This type of research may require extensive naturalistic observations of groups over long periods, but \nthe data would provide rich information on what types of models operate best in the setting.  \n \nIn using peer  trainers, a teacher initially trains one or more students to demonstrate skills and how to teach these \nto other students. Peer trainers have been used successfully to teach social skills, where trainers initiate social \ninteractions with socially withdrawn  children by using verbal signals (e.g., \"Let's play blocks.\") and motor \nresponses (e.g., handing the child a toy; Strain, Kerr, & Ragland, 1981). Research is needed that broadens the \npeer trainer's role to include self -regulatory skills; for example, trai ners who assist other stu dents in setting \ngoals, prioritizing task assignments, and monitoring progress in learning.  \n \nTransfer  \nA second area of research we recommend is on factors affect ing transfer of self -regulatory skills. Transfer \nincludes main tenance of skills over time and generalization across contexts and subject domains. Transfer is \nimportant because self -regulation is involved in the academic, social, and motor skill domains.  \n \nTheory and research suggest that transfer is not automatic and that a variety of factors affect it. Factors that have \nbeen shown to be important include possessing the requisite skill; under standing when and where the \nknowledge, skills, or strategies may be useful; knowing how to modify applications of skills or strategies to fit \ndifferent settings and content; having the oppor tunity to practice with new material; and believing that the skill \nor strategy is useful with the new content or in the new setting (Borkowski & Cavanaugh, 1979; Pressley et al., \n1990; Salomon & Perkins, 1989; Schunk, 1994).  \n \nTransfer has been an important topic in the history of learning and is addressed by many learning theories \n(Schunk, 1996b). Much research has explored mechanisms of transfer including recognizing common features \nbetween situ ations, linking of knowledge in memory, and understanding the value of the skill or strategy in \ndifferent contexts. We suggest that modeling and self -efficacy influence transfer, and we advo cate increased \nresearch emphasis on the transfer of self -regulatory skills.  \n \nResearchers interested in this topic might consider Phye's (1989, 1990) model for enhancing transfer. During \nthe acquisition phase, learners receive instruction and prac tice including assessment of their awareness of uses \nof the strategy. The retention phase includes more practice on training materials and recall measures. The \ntransfer phase occurs when students attempt to solve new problems that have different surface characteristics \nbut that require the same strategy practiced d uring instruction. Phye also em phasizes the role of motivation for \ntransfer and ways to boost motivation by highlighting uses of knowledge and strategies to learners.  \n \nIn this view, modeling is important for enhancing acqui sition and motivation, and also can help provide \ncorrective or supplementary instruction during retention and transfer. We might investigate what features of \nmodeled displays are most important for transfer. Thus, verbalizing applica bility of a strategy to different \nsituations may prove  useful, as might coping statements designed to raise self -efficacy (e.g., \"I think I can use \nthis same strategy to solve this problem. Let me think about how to apply it.\"). We also can determine where \ntransfer occurs in our levels of self -regulation; for  example, are verbal descriptions adequate or do learners \nrequire the more intensive feedback that typically occurs at the imitative level?  \n \nTeacher Control of Instruction  \nA third area where we recommend research concerns the extent that learners benefit from structured \nexperiences that include a high degree of teacher control over instruction. We suggest that social learning \nexperiences can be planned and organized by teachers and parents to accelerate children's self -regulato ry \ndevelopment. Although widespread agree ment exists about the importance of self -regulatory processes in \nstudents' learning, not everyone shares our advocacy. Gardner (1991), for example, proposed a development \nlearn ing model that parallels the type of natural, spontaneous learning that young children engage in, \nparticularly before they enter school. Learning is a constructive process in which children develop their own \nunderstandings of the world based on their interactions with it by searching for, cho osing, and processing "}
