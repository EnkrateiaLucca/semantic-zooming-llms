A social cognitive perspective on self -regulation is presented. In this \nview, students' academic com petence develops initially from social sources of academic skill and subsequently \nshifts to self sources in a series of 4 levels: observational, imitative, self -controlled, and self -regulated. The \neffects of models on observers depend in part on perception s of self-efficacy, or beliefs about one's capabilities \nto learn or perform designated behaviors. Research on social influences is reviewed, and includes factors such \nas cognitive modeling, coping and mastery models, self -modeling, learning goals, and progress feedback. \nRelated theoretical perspectives are discussed along with suggestions for future research.  \n \nArticle:  \nSuccessful adaptation to school requires that students develop self-regulation, or processes that activate and \nsustain cogni tions, behaviors,  and affects, and that are oriented toward goal attainment (Zimmerman, 1989, \n1990). Academic self -regula tory processes include planning and managing time; attending to and concentrating \non instruction; organizing, rehearsing, and coding information strategically; establishing a produc tive work \nenvironment; and using social resources effectively (Kanfer & Kanfer, 1991; Karoly, 1993; Pressley et al., \n1990; Zimmerman, 1 994). Self -regulation also incorporates moti vational processes such as setting performance \ngoals and outcomes; holding positive beliefs about one's capabilities; valuing learning and its anticipated \noutcomes; and experienc ing positive affects (e.g., prid e, satisfaction) with one's efforts (McCombs, 1989; \nSchunk, 1994).  \n \nThe development of self -regulation is affected by many factors, but an important set comprises socialization \ninflu ences. Several years ago researchers hypothesized that chil dren' s exposu re to socializing agents (e.g., \nmodels) influences their behavioral and cognitive development to include the acquisition of concepts, attitudes, \npreferences, and standards for self -reward and self -punishment (Bandura & Walters, 1963; Hartup, 1978; \nMischel,  1968). Much research shows that children readily induce and transfer concepts that underlie modeling \nsequences (Bandura, 1986; Rosenthal & Zimmer man, 1978; Zimmerman & Rosenthal, 1974).  \n \nIn recent years, cognitive theorists have shifted their atten tion t o the process whereby self -regulatory \ncompetence is internalized and have studied how children arid adolescents learn to function independently from \nsocializing agents in an adaptive, generative, and creative manner (Bandura, 1986; Como, 1989; Fuson, 1979;  \nKopp, 1982; Mithaug, 1993; Paris & Newman, 1990; Vygotsky, 1978; Wertsch, 1979; Zimmer man, in press). \nIn this article we identify and review research on the social origins of students' development of self -regula tory \nskill with special emphasis on observational learning through modeling. Modeling occurs when observers \npattern their behaviors, strategies, thoughts, beliefs, and affects after those of one or more models (Schunk, \n1987). Recent research has demonstrat ed the effectiveness of modeling self -regula tory skills as a means of \npromoting students' academic achievement and associated self-efficacy beliefs (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994). \nResearchers hypothesize that self -efficacy, or personal beliefs about one's ca pabilities to learn or perform "}
