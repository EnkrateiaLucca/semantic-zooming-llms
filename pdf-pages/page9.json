{"page": 9, "content": "two well -known and often -cited perspectives bea ring on the development of self -regulation: sociocultural \ntheory and self -determination theory.  \n \nSociocultural Theory  \nVygotsky (1962, 1978) suggested that children's self -regula tory activities grow from social interactions between \nadults or more mature peers and learners in four stages. He observed that adults provide support within \nchildren's zone of proximal development on tasks they cannot perform by themselves. The adults and children \ncollaborate to complete tasks, and social dialogue between them helps develop children's self -direc tive speech, \nwhich is believed to be the source of self -regula tory control.  \n \nIn the first stage, infants respond reflexively to the envi ronment in stimulus \u2013response fashion on the basis of a \npreprogrammed nervous system. Adults regulate infants' behav ior by controlling immediate stimuli in the \nenvironment using signs\u2014especially speech cues. During the second stage, tod dlers begin to mediate \nbehavioral responding using external signs as an aid, but these youngsters have mastered only concrete, external \nconnections between signs and stimuli. They begin to use signs in order to influence other people around them. \nDuring the third stage, young children can regulate their own behavio r by actively organizing their stimulus \nfields to achieve desired responses. Signs \u2014particu larly speech \u2014become internalized during this stage, and \nyoungsters manipulate them to carry out behavioral opera tions. The word as a sign of socially shared meaning  \nbecomes the most useful tool in young children's attempts to master their environment Finally, during the fourth \nstage, external relations among stimuli, signs, and behavior become fully internalized. During, this self -\nregulated phase, children begin to function without the aid of external signs because basic processes have been \ntransformed linguistically into tools for planning and guiding cognitive and behavioral activities.  \n \nVygotsky viewed self -regulation as a generalized trait or stage of competence th at children develop by the early \nelementary school grades when self -directive speech is believed  to become covert, but one should note that \nmany contempo rary instructional adaptations of Vygotsky' s theory no longer adhere to this generalized stage \nassumption (Gallimore & Tharp, 1990). Perhaps because Vygotsky sought to explain self-regulatory \ncompetence but not performance, he said little about what motivates self -regulatory activity except that chil dren \nwill be mot ivated when learning activities are embedded in a social system involving joint participation in \nlearning with peers or teachers (Henderson & Cunningham, 1994). When teaching self -regulation, Vygotsky \nemphasized the role of verbal intersubjectivity between  adults and children as the primary source of children's \ninternalization of self -directed speech. Reciprocal teaching involving verbal elaboration and explanation \nbetween adults and children is perceived as better for self -regulatory development than direc t verbal modeling, \nwhich is assumed to produce passive compliance (Diaz, Neal, & Amaya -Williams, 1990).  \n \nLike Vygotsky, social cognitive researchers emphasize the importance of socialization influences, but we stress \nthe roles of other triadic learning proc esses besides self -verbalization. These include self -controlled practice of \nmotoric elements, use of environmental resources, and reliance on additional personal processes, such as \ncognitive strategies, nonverbal imagery, and affect (Schunk, 1989; Zimmerma n, 1989; Zim merman & \nRisemberg, 1997). The Vygotskian assumption that modeling leads to passivity is questioned on the basis of \nextensive evidence that observational learning and imitation primarily elicit cognitively constructive processes \nrather than passive compliance or mimicry (Rosenthal & Zimmerman, 1978; Zimmerman & Rosenthal, 1974).  \n \nIn contrast to Vygotsky' s generalized stage account of self-regulatory development, social cognitive researchers \nview self -regulation as a domain -specific level of skillful functioning. In addition to the development of task -\nrelated competence, a triadic account of self -regulation seeks to explain lapses in performance depending on \nadverse environ mental, personal, o r behavioral conditions, This multifaceted explanation for self -regulatory \ncompetence and performance considers both the developmental level and task -dependence of specific \nprocesses, such as strategy use and self -monitoring (e.g., Schunk & Swartz, 1993; Z immerman & Kitsantas, \n1996, 1997), as well as specific sources of motivation, such as self -reinforcement and self -efficacy beliefs. \nBecause of these features, this developmental level formulation can ad dress human functioning beyond "}
