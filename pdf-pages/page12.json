In the early phases of learning, many \nstudents may perceive themselves more similar in competence to coping models.  \n \nSchunk and Hanson (1985) determined the effects on children's achievement outcomes of peer mastery and \ncoping models, adult models, and no models. Mastery models solved subtraction problems correctly and \nverbalized statements re flecting high self -efficacy and ability, low task difficulty, and positive attitudes. Coping \nmodels initially made errors and verbalized negative statements, but then verbalized coping statements (e.g., \"I \nneed to pay attention to what I'm doing.\") and eventually verbalized and performed as well as mastery models.  \nMastery and coping models increased self -efficacy  and subtraction achievement better than adult models or no \nmodels; adult -model childre n outperformed no -model stu dents. Although adult models can teach students self -\nregula tory skills, students' self -efficacy for learning may be aided better by observation of similar peers. In turn, \nself-efficacy can sustain motivation for skill improveme nt. \n \nThe lack of differences between the coping and mastery model conditions may have arisen because children had \npreviously experienced success with subtraction; thus, any type of peer model would have raised efficacy. \nSchunk, Hanson, and Cox (1987) further explored the coping -mastery model distinction and found that \nobserving coping models enhances children's self -efficacy and skillful performance more than does observing \nmastery models. Unlike Schunk and Hanson (1985), Schunk et al. ( 1987) used a task (fractions) at which \nchildren had not previously been successful. Coping models may be more beneficial when students have little \ntask famili arity or have encountered previous learning difficulties. Schunk et al. also showed that multiple  \nmodels (coping or mastery) promote outcomes as well as a single coping model and better than a single mastery \nmodel. With multiple models, learners are apt to perceive themselves as similar to at least one model.  \n \nModels also can help to develop an observational level of self-regulatory competence by verbalizing and acting \nin ac cordance with abstract rules and concepts for self -regulation. For example, Bandura and Kupers (1964) \nshowed children a model demonstrating  stringent or lenient standards while playing a bowling game. Children \nexposed to high -standard models were more likely to reward themselves for high scores and less likely to \nreward themselves for low scores compared with individuals assigned to the low -standard condition. Davidson \nand Smith (1982) had children observe a superior adult, equal peer, or inferior younger child set stringent or \nlenient standards while performing a pursuit -rotor task. Chil dren who observed a lenient model rewarded \nthemselves f or lower scores more than did children who observed a stringent model. Children's self -reward \nstandards were lower than those displayed by the adult, equal to those portrayed by the peer, and higher than \nthose demonstrated by the younger children. Age simi larity may have led children to believe that the standards \nadopted by the peer were the most appropriate for them.  \n \nModels often provide social evaluative cues, feedback, and assistance to help observers achieve an imitation \nlevel of self-regulatory competence. France -Kaatrude and Smith (1985) had first and fourth graders perform a \npursuit -rotor task and allowed children to compare their performances with a peer, of higher, equal, or lower \ncompetence. Relative to children offered socia l comparisons with superior or inferior peers, children who could \ncompare with a similarly perform ing peer did so more often, displayed greater task persistence, and took fewer \nrewards.  \n \nAnother effective, method of developing imitative compe tence is self -modeling, which involves observing one's \nown performances (Dowrick, 1983). In a typical study, partici pants are videotaped while performing a task and \nsubsequently view their tapes. Tapes allow for review and are especially informative for tasks one can not watch \nwhile per forming (e.g., motor skills, social interactions). When per formances contain errors, having a \nknowledgeable individual provide feedback during tape review helps to prevent per formers (observers) from \nbecoming discouraged. The expert can explain how to execute the behaviors better the next time. Tapes can \nconvey to observers that they are becoming more skillful and will continue to make progress by employing \neffective self -regulatory strategies. These beliefs raise ob servers' self -efficacy for continued learning.  \n "}
