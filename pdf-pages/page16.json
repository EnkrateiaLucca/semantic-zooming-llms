Teachers are not \nconveyors of instruction but rather establish rich environ ments and provide for social guidance and \napprenticeships. Intrins ic motivation in learning is sustained through active participation in learning and \nperceptions of progress and competence.  \n \nThe approach we advocate shares many features with that Gardner (1991) espouses including the emphasis on \nsocial guidance, apprenticeships (which use mastery models), self -perceptions of progress, and self -evaluations \nof competence.  At the same time, we place greater emphasis on the role of structured experiences to foster \ndevelopment of self -regula tory skills. Evid ence shows that self -organized learning with out teacher guidance can \nlead to substantial deficits in stu dents' knowledge (Brown & Van Lehn, 1982; Weinert & Helmke, 1995).  \n \nWeinert and Helmke discuss several advantages of teacher -controlled instruction inc luding maintaining a strong \nacademic focus, minimizing classroom disruptions, diagnosing and remedying academic problems, and ensur -\ning student learning progress and achievement. These authors contend that learning goals must be considered \nwhen designing instruction. If the goal is to help students become independent thinkers (e.g., problem solvers), \nthen methods that encourage this should be implemented; con versely, if the goal is to ensure knowledge \nacquisition and achievement (e.g., basi c skills), then greater teacher control of instruction is desirable.  \n \nAdditionally, situating learning within contexts is not nec essarily best. How closely learning is tied to a \nparticular context should depend on the type of knowledge, skill, or strategy to be acquired (Anderson, Reder, \n& Simon, 1996). As Anderson et at exemplify, arithmetic carrying is bound to the context of base -10 addition \nand will not generalize to another base system. Conversely, reading is not as context bound. To the extent that \nself-regulatory skills can be taught in different domains, we do not recommend that all learning be contextually \nsituated.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nA social cognitive view of self -regulatory development offers several distinctive features that are important in \nexplaining existing evidence regarding students' academic self -regula tion. First, it describes how self -regulatory \nskill and a sense of self -efficacy grow out of specific social learning instruc tional experiences, including \nmodeling and socially rein forced attempt s to imitate as well as self -controlled study or practice efforts. Second, \na phase model of self -regulatory development describes shifts in students' methods of learning and sources of \npersonal motivation. Existing developmental formulations, such as Vygot sky's theory and self -determina tion \ntheory, focus on either learning or motivation but not the interaction of these two key dimensions of self -\nregulation (Bandura, 1986, in press; Pintrich & Schunk, 1996; Schunk, 1996b; Zimmerman, 1994). The ultimate \ndeve lopment of students' academic self -regulatory skill depends on the grow ing synergy between their use of \nself-regulated learning proc esses and derived forms of self -motivation, such as perceived self-efficacy. A social \ncognitive phase model provides the conceptual and empirical basis for systematically developing both the \nlearning processes and motivational beliefs that define self -regulated learners.  \n \nREFERENCES  \nAmes, C.
