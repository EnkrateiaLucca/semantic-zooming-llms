{"page": 8, "content": "Social cognitive researchers view self -regulation as a do main -specific level of acquired skill that depends on \nseveral task-dependent processes, such as planning, strategizing, de veloping motoric proficiency, and self -\nmonitoring. For exam ple, students'  competence to self -monitor and self -adjust their academic writing usually \ndiffers from the same self -regula tory competencies in mathematical reasoning or performing a sport. These \ntask-dependent processes allow this phase or level perspective to explain specific forms of skill develop ment \nbeyond children's initial ability to self -adjust their per formance to common tasks, such as older students' and \nadults' expert mastery of specialized skills (Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 1996, 1997).  \n \nThis phase formulation of self -regulatory development differs from stage conceptualizations by its emphasis on \nan optimal sequence of social learning interactions rather than  on an invariant sequence of age -related personal \ntraits or cognitive stages. Acco rding to this phase model, learning is optimized when the needed form of social \ninstruction is matched to the students' level of regulatory skill on the task in question. Either premature or \ndelayed reliance on self -regulatory processes can retard the spe ed of learning and the ultimate degree of \nachievement (Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 1997). Most coaches can tell stories of strong -willed students who have \nresisted instructional advice and shifted to self -directed practice before they were ready.  \n \nNot only may students shift their instructional phase inap propriately, they may attempt to skip some phases \nentirely. For example, a student may not have access to an exemplary model to learn a skill or may choose to \ndevelop the skill on his or her own. He or she woul d, in essence, miss the first three stages and try to begin at a \nself-regulatory level. This trial-and-error approach to skill development fails to build on social cultural advances \nin learning and generally reduces the speed and amount of learning for mos t complex skills because it \npresupposes underlying self -regulatory processes, such as effective strategies and self -monitoring. A social \ncognitive phase model of self -regulatory development also assumes that learners may need to recycle through \nearlier instructional phases periodically because of slumps, ruts, or setbacks. For example, several professional \ngolfers have gone back to prior coaches when they lost control of some aspect of their game.  \n \nWhat develop s is students' capability to learn and perform a specific task effectively under decreasing levels of \nsocial\u2013instructional support. Although increases in the use and quality of self -regulatory processes and reliance \non internal ized forms of motivation ar e expected to improve one's effectiveness, other factors affect \nperformance outcomes as well, such as mental and physical abilities. A child with a learning disability may \nneed to engage in high levels of self-regulation to read at his or her grade level. Factor analytic research \n(Zimmerman & Martinez -Pons, 1988) has shown that academic self -regulatory skill is distinctive from but \ncorrelated with indices of both ability and achievement. Thus, achievement is a confounded index of self -\nregulatory skill. To determine students' phase level of self -regulatory devel opment, testing their domain -specific \nskill under varying circumstances of social support is necessary.  \n \nThe purpose of a social cognitive phase model is not to classify learners on an invariant pr ogression of mutually \nexclusive stages. Rather, it is to guide social \u2013instructional experiences to enhance students' development of self -\nregula tory processes during specific learning episodes. Learning is optimized when social parameters of \ninstruction ar e matched to the student's phase of regulatory development, and devel opment is optimized when \nlearning episodes socially convey the processes needed to personally regulate at the next phase level. Students \ninternalize more than an academic skill from these social learning episodes; they acquire the tools for further \nlearning the skill more effectively on their own, such as how to self -monitor and self -adjust their study efforts.  \nSelf-regulatory development is a dynamic sequence of inter -to intrapersona l shifts rather than an unidirectional \nage-related progression of mutually exclusive stages. Unlike nativist stage theories that assume development \nconstrains learning (e.g., Piaget, 1970), a social cognitive phase model seeks to describe how learning and  self-\nregulatory development are reciprocally beneficial (Zimmerman, 1995a).  \n \nRELATED VIEWS  \nAlthough this article focuses on social cognitive theory, other theoretical perspectives address the development \nof self -regulation. Our purpose is not to provide a complete review of applicable self -regulation theories; an \nextensive discussion would alter the article's focus and extend beyond its intended scope.
