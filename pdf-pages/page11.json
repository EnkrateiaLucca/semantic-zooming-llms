Although Vygotsky' s theory could be used to expla in \ncognitive features of self -regulatory development and self -determination theory could be used to describe \nmotivational features, we suggest that an integrative explanation for both learning and motivational processes is \npreferable. Self -regulated learne rs are distin guished by their self -reliant methods of learning as well as their \nself-motivation (Zimmerman, 1989).  \n \nA social cognitive phase model seeks to describe how an optimal sequence of social learning episodes \nsystemati cally reduces social instruct ional support and external sources of motivation as students become more \nself-regulatory and more self -motivated. A comprehensive account of self -regulatory development must \ndescribe the interac tion between learning and motivation. For example, self -monitored changes in learning \nduring the self -control and self-regulation phases enhance self -reinforcement and self -efficacy beliefs as well as \nprovide feedback about the effectiveness of particular learning strategies. We believe that an integrative mode l \nof self -regulatory learning and motivational development is essential for guiding research and instructional \napplications.  \n \nRESEARCH EVIDENCE  \nThis section presents a limited review of research on the social origins of self -regulatory competence. As \nshoWil in Table 1, social origins include models, verbal description, social guid ance, and feedback. To further \nfocus our review, we summa rize primarily research on observational learning through modeling. Self -\ninfluences, which include factors such as self -instruction, personal goal setting, self -monitoring, self -evalu ation, \nhelp seeking, and time management, extend beyond the scope of this article and are discussed in detail \nelsewhere (Bandura, 1986; Schunk & Z immerman, 1996). One should note that social and self factors can \ninteract and that self factors can be affected by influences in the social environ ment. For example, internal \nstandards can be acquired through observations of models. In general, however, self influences depend less on \nthe social environment than do the social influences.  \n \nModels and Verbal Description  \nExtensive literature exists on the role of modeling in social development (Rosenthal & Bandura, 1978). The \ntopic has experienced renewed interest lately due to its relevance to educational processes such as peer \ncollaboration, mentoring, and apprenticeships (Bailey, 1993; Cohen, 1994).  \n \nModels are important sources for the initial development of self -regulation --an observ ational level of self -\nregulatory competence. By observing models, students acquire knowl edge and strategies that they subsequently \napply as they work on tasks. Modeled actions also convey to observers that they can succeed if they follow the \nsame sequence . Students who believe they know what to do to perform a task feel more efficacious about \nsucceeding, and this sense of efficacy is increased as observers experience performance success (Schunk, 1987).  \n \nAn important means of developing an observational , level of self -regulatory competence is through cognitive \nmodeling (discussed earlier). Schunk (1981) gave children who had difficulty in mathematics either cognitive \nmodeling or didac tic instruction. In the modeling treatment children observed an adult model  verbalize long --\ndivision solution steps while applying them to problems. The didactic treatment consisted of children reviewing \ninstructional, pages that portrayed step -by-step solutions of division problems. Both cognitive mod eling and \ndidactic instruction led to significant increases in self-efficacy, skill learning, and persistence, but modeling \nresulted in significantly greater division skill learning com pared with the didactic treatment. Results of a path \nanalysis showed t hat self -efficacy exerted a direct effect on both persistence and learning.  \n \nPerceived similarity to models in important attributes can raise observers' self -efficacy and motivation when \nobservers believe that if others can succeed they can as well (Schunk,  1987). One way to increase model \u2014\nobserver similarity may be with coping models, who initially demonstrate the typical problems and possibly \nfears of observers but gradually im prove their performances and gain self -confidence. These models illustrate \nhow effort and positive thoughts can over come difficulties. Coping models contrast with mastery mod els, who "}
