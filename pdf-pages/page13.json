Subsequent self -modeling benefits were obtained as these children displayed higher \nself-efficacy, motivation, and self -regulated strategy use than did children who had been taped but did not \nobserve their tapes and children who had not been taped.  \n \nTeachers must fade social and instructional supports and encourage students to work on their own so t hat \nstudents may achieve an imitative level of competence. Fading can be done gradually as students abstract the \nunderlying learning strategy and receive progress feedback.  \n \nSocial Guidance and Feedback  \nResearch by Schunk and Swartz (1993) illustrates how stu dents can be guided from the imitative learning level \nto a self-controlled level of self -regulatory competence through social guidance and feedback. The context was \ninstruction on paragraph writing w ith elementary -school children. Students received writing instruction from an \nadult model, who dem onstrated application of a five -step writing strategy (e.g., choose a topic to write about, \npick the main idea). Once children observed the model they receiv ed guided practice applying it to paragraphs \n(e.g., descriptive, narrative, infor mative). Eventually the guided practice shifted to independent practice where \nstudents worked on their own. Thus, the adult support initially present was gradually lessened as students \ngained imitative competence. Researchers expected that stu dents who had attained a self -controlled level of \ncompetence would fare better if they were given a process (learning) goal rather than a product (performance) \ngoal to guide their self -directed practice.  \n \nFour experimental conditions existed: process (learning) goal, process goal plus progress feedback, product \n(perform ance) goal, general (instructional control) goal. Process -goal and proc ess-goal plus progress -feedback \nstudents received instructions at the start of each session that emphasized a goal of learning to use the strategy \nto write paragraphs. Product -goal students were told that their goal was to write paragraphs; general -goal \nchildren were advised to do their best. Other  types of goals mentioned in the literature that are conceptually \nsimilar to process (learning) goals include mastery goals, task-involved goals, and task -focused goals (Ames, \n1992; Butler, 1992; Meece, 1991; Nicholls, 1984; Wentzel, 1992); synonyms for product (performance) goals \ninclude ego -involved goals and ability -focused goals.  \n \nChildren assigned to the process -goal plus progress -feedback condition periodically received social (verbal) \nfeedback from the adult model that linked their use of the strategy with improved writing performance (e.g., \n\"You're doing well be cause you followed the steps in order.\"). Feedback was given contingent on students using \nthe strategy properly. Sch unk and Swartz felt that in a subject such as writing, progress often is difficult to \ngauge on one's own; thus, the feedback would inform students of their learning progress and raise self -efficacy \nand motivation.  \n \nThe process -goal plus feedback condition was the most effective and some benefits of the process goal alone \nalso occurred. Process -goal plus feedback students generally outperformed product - and general -goal students \non self -efficacy and writing skill. The former students also dem onstrated the greatest amount of strategy use \nwhile writing paragraphs. Gains made by process -goal plus feedback students were maintained after 6 weeks \nand generalized to types of paragraphs on which students had received no instruction.  \n \nGraham and Harris (1989a, 1989b; Sawyer, Graham, & Harris, 1992) showed that teaching students with \nlearning disabilities a strategy for writing essays or stories improves their self -efficacy and writing performance \nand that gains are maintained after inst ruction and generalize to other settings and content. A cognitive \nmodeling procedure was used in which models explained and demonstrated the strategy while applying its steps \nto write stories. Models also conveyed to students the value of strategy use by providing feedback emphasizing \nthat strategy use would help students attain their learning goals. Other components of the procedure were self -\nmonitoring of writing perform ance and self -evaluation of progress by comparing goals with achievement.  \n "}
