{"page": 6, "content": "Learners often receive from teachers, parents, coaches, and peers persuasive information that they are capable \nof perform ing a task (e.g., \"You can do this.\"). Such information can raise efficacy but can lose its influence  \nfrom subsequent performance failure (Bandura, 1997). Students also acquire efficacy information from \nphysiological reactions (e.g., sweating, heart rate). Symptoms signaling anxiety may con vey that one lacks skill; \nlower anxiety may be construed as a sign of greater competency. It should be noted that sources may offer \nconflicting information; for example, a teacher gives positive feedback, but a student feels highly anxious. We \ncannot alway s predict which source will have the strong est effect on efficacy; it may depend on factors such as \nprior experiences, source credibility, and motivational influences (e.g., peer pressure).  \n \nSelf-efficacy is an important influence on achievement behavior b ut not the only one. High self -efficacy will \nnot produce competent performances when requisite knowledge and skills are lacking, Outcome expectations \nare influential because students engage in activities they believe will lead to positive outcomes (Shell, Murphy, \n& Bruning, 1989). Per ceived value \u2014the perceived importance of learning, or what use will be made of what \none learns \u2014affects behavior be cause learners show little interest in activities they do not value. Assuming, \nthen,  that students possess adequate skill, hold positive outcome expectations, and value what they are learning, \nself-efficacy is hypothesized to exert an important effect on the instigation, direction, and persistence of \nachieve ment behavior.  \n \nEffective self -regulation depends on feeling self -effica cious for using skills to achieve mastery (Bandura, 1986, \n1997; Bouffard -Bouchard, Parent, & Larivee, 1991; Schunk, 1996a; Zimmerman, 1989). As students work on a \ntask, they compare their performances to their goals. Self -evaluations of progress enhance self -efficacy and \nmaintain motivation to improve. Students who feel efficacious about learning or performing well are apt to \nimplement effective self -regulatory strategies, suc h as concentrating on the task, using proper procedures, \nmanaging time effectively, seeking assistance as necessary, and monitoring performance and adjusting strate -\ngies as needed (McCombs, 1989; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990; Zimmerman, 1994). The latter self -regulatory \nstrategies are types of volitional processes (Corno, 1993) because they involve task and self -management rather \nthan personal ap praisals of efficacy.  \n \nAlthough low self -efficacy is detrimental, effective self regulation does not require that self -efficacy be \nexceptionally high. Salomon (1984) found that a slightly lower sense of self-efficacy led to greater mental effort \nand better learning than did extreme confidence. There is a limit, however; a very low sens e of efficacy does not \nmotivate. Assuming that learn ers feel efficacious about surmounting problems, holding some doubt about \nsuccess may mobilize effort and effective use of strategies more than does feeling overly confident.  \n \nDevelopment of Self -Regulatory Competence  \nZimmerman and Bonner (in press) advanced a social cogni tive theoretical model of the development of self -\nregulatory competence (Table 1). The model predicts that academic competence develops initially from social \nsources and sub sequently shifts to self sources in a series of levels. Novice learners acquire self -regulatory skills \nand strategies most  rapidly from social modeling, tuition, task structuring, and encouragement (Zimmerman & \nRosenthal, 1974). Although many learners can induce the major features of strategies from watching a model \n(observational level of academic skill), most of them will benefit from actually performing the strate gies to help \nincorporate them into their behavioral repertoires. If a model adopts a teaching role and provides guidance, \nfeedback, and social reinforcement during practice, he or she can improve the observer's behavioral accuracy of \n"}
