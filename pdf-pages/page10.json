{"page": 10, "content": "children's initial abi lity to self-adjust their performance \u2014especially older children's and adults' expert \ncompetence and performance (Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Zimmerman, in press).  \n \nSelf-Determination Theory  \nIn the context of the theory of self -determination, Deci and colleagues (Deci & Ryan, 1991; Rigby, Deci, \nPatrick, & Ryan, 1992; Ryan, Connell, & Deci, 1985) discussed the process whereby extrinsic controls, \nrewards, and structures  become internalized and integrated into the self -regulation system. This self -\ndetermin ation view is relevant to our per spective because it describes a multistage process of increas ing self -\nregulation and involves external factors that initially are not part of children's self -regulatory processes but are \nmotivational and help produce desi rable social functioning.  \n \nThe activities of interest are extrinsic in that they are not activities engaged in for their own sake (intrinsic) but \nrather are performed because of external controls, to obtain rewards, or to please others. Internalization is the \nprocess whereby individuals transform regulation by external events into regu lation by internal factors (self -\ndetermination). This is an organismic process that involves children assimilating the socializing environment \nand accommodating to its demands (Ryan et al., 1985). According to self -determination theory, the origins of \nself-regulatory behavior lie in social factors that are not intrinsically (naturally) motivating.  \n \nDeci and associates descr ibe a continuum of internaliza tion. At the lowest level, external regulation, students \nperform (or do not perform) activities based on expected extrinsic contingencies (i.e., to obtain :rewards or \navoid punishments). We find little self -determination, for  example, when students work on a task to obtain \nteacher praise or to avoid criticism.  \n \nThe next level, introjected regulation, involves contin gently applied self -approval or self -disapproval. The \nsource of motivation is internal (feelings of should, ought , guilt) to the student but not self -determined because \nthe motivation seems to be controlling the student. Students display intro jected regulation when they engage in \nan activity out of feelings of guilt (they will feel guilty if they do not perform it) or to avoid anxiety and self -\ndisapproval that would accom pany failure and feel better about themselves when they perform well (i.e., they \nare glad they did it).  \n \nAt the third level, identified regulation, people engage in an activity because it is personal ly important to them. \nThe regulation, which previously was extrinsic, is now viewed as one's own goal or value and thereby largely \nself-determined. Students display identified regulation when they study dili gently to make good enough grades \nto be accepted  by a university or when they spend extra hours working on cars to become skillful enough to \nobtain a mechanic's position. These goals have extrinsic utility value but they are personally meaningful to the \nstudents, although these are not the same as being intrinsically motivated.  \n \nIn the final level of extrinsic motivation, integrated regu lation, people integrate internal and external sources of \ninfor mation into their current identifications. Students engage in behavior because of its importance to their \nsense of self. One might have multiple goals (e.g., learn material and relate well to others) that do not \nnecessarily interfere with one another. This represents a mature level of self -regulation that typically is \nattainable only in late adolescence (Ryan et al., 1985). Although this final level is still instrumental rather than \nreflecting intrinsic motivation, it represents a form of self -determinatio n and autonomy (Pintrich & Schunk, \n1996).  \n \nUnlike Vygotsky' s theory, the self -determination perspec tive focuses mainly on developmental changes in \nmotivation from extrinsic to intrinsic sources but says relatively little about developmental changes in the  self-\nregulation of learn ing. This perspective describes developmental shifts in why students learn but not in how \nstudents learn on their own. Like a social cognitive phase model, the self -determination view postulates a series \nof levels characterized by increasing self -motivation. We suggest that an optimal model of self -regula tory \ndevelopment needs to explain not only increasing self -motivation but  also enhanced self -regulation of learning, \nsuch as children's increasing capability to set goals, concentrate, self-monitor, and use strategies on their own "}
