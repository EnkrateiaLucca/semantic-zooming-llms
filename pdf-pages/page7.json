During participant or mastery modeling (Bandura, 1986), the \nmodel repeats selected aspects of the strategy and guides enactment based on the learners' imitative accuracy. \nThe primary source of motivation during this phase is vicarious reinforcement. Suc cessful models and their \nmethods are emulated; unsuccessful ones are avoided.  \n \nAn imitative level of self -regulatory competence is at tained when the learner's performance approximates the \ngeneral form of the model. The observer is not copying the exact actions of the model; rather, the learner \nemulates the model's general pattern or style of functioning. For example, the learner may imitate the type of \nquestion a model asks but not duplicate the model's precise wording (Zimmerman & Rosenthal, 1974). The \ndistinction between the observational level and the imitative level of self -regulatory skill and the sequential \ndependence of the latter on the former stems from the early social cognitive research  separating cognitive \nacqui sition from motoric performance. Bandura (1965) showed that what is learned vicariously is riot \nnecessarily manifested in imitative responses unless the student possesses the requi site motoric skill and \nmotivation. Socially rei nforced motoric practice was found to be important in developing imitative accuracy \n(Bandura, 1977). Recent research has revealed that students trained to discriminate essential qualitative features \nof a modeled novel speech form cognitively displayed not only faster imitative learning of the speech skill but \nalso greater self -efficacy about their learning progress than un trained counterparts (Ellis, 1995).  \n \nThe source of learning of self -regulatory skill is primarily social for the first two levels of academic \ncompetence; most research summarized in this article addresses social influ ences. At more advanced stages, the \nlocus shifts to self sources. We discuss some higher level research, but we refer readers to Schunk and \nZimmerman (1996) for a thorough discussion of research at the self level.  \n \nThe most apparent manifestation of the third, self -controlled level of academic self -regulatory skill, is the \ncapability of learners to use the strategy independently when performing transfer tasks. Students' use of a self -\nregula tory strategy becomes internalized during this phase, but it remains dependent on representational \nstandards of a model's performance (i.e., covert images and verbal mean ings) and the self -reinforcement that \nstems from behavior ally matching these representations (Bandura & Jeffery, 1973).  \n \nA higher level of self -functioning is needed to deal with more complex situations. The fourth, self -regulated \nlevel of self-regulatory skill, allows learners to systematically adapt their learning strategies to changing \npersonal and contextual conditions (Bandura, 1986). At this level of competence, the learner can initiate use of \nstrategies, incorporate adjustments based on contextual fe atures of the situation, and maintain motivation by \nself-efficacy perceptions of enactive success. The learner chooses when to use a strategy and varies its features \nself-regulatively with little or no residual dependence on the model during this phase. Although this self -\nregulated level of functioning emerges from specific social learning experiences, it depends in part on children's \noverall cognitive and mot oric development.  \n \nThis four -level analysis of the development of self -regulatory competence begins with acquiring knowledge of \nlearn ing skills (observation) and includes using these skills (imi tation), internalizing them (self -control), and \nemploying th em adaptively (self -regulation). The primary source of motiva tion also shifts from social to self -\nregulated sources: Vicari ous, reinforcement assumes prominence during observation, direct reinforcement \nduring imitation, self -reinforcement dur ing the sel f-control phase, and self -efficacy beliefs during the self-\nregulatory phase. Although a developmental progression occurs from social to self -influences, it is assumed that \npersonal self -regulatory influences (e.g., self -efficacy, metacog nition, and affec t) remain reciprocally \ninterdependent with social\u2014environmental and behavioral triadic influences (Zim merman, 1989). Self -\nregulation does not imply a person's obliviousness to social influences but rather his or her inten tional, self -\nobservant use of the se social forces. Consider the example of expert tennis players who self -select personal \ncoaches to work on developing effective court strategies and on keeping mechanical flaws from entering their \ngame. These self-regulated players rely on their athletic expertise to choose valuable social assistance. In \nsimilar fashion, students who self-regulate their academic learning have been found to seek help strategically \n(Newman, 1994; Zimmerman & Martinez -Pons, 1986).  "}
