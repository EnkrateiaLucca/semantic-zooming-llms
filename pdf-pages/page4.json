Standards often are ac quired by observing models (Bandura, \n1986); socially com paring one's perfornninces with those of others helps one  evaluate the appropriateness of \nbehavior. Social comparisons are used in the self -judgment process when absolute standards are not in effect  or \nare unclear (Schunk, 1996a).  \n \nSelf-judgments are also affected by the importance and informativeness of standard s. People are more likely to \njudge their task progress for tasks they value. They may not assess their performance or expend effort to \nimprove their skills for tasks in which they have little interest in how they perform.  \n \nComparing one's performance against standards provides information about progress. Students who must learn \n30 new spelling words in a week know they are ahead of schedule if they learn 10 words the first day.  \n \nSelf reaction involves making evaluative responses to judgments of one's performance; for example, whether it \nis good or bad, acceptable or not acceptable, beyond or below expectation. These evaluative reactions constitute \na critical aspect of self -regulation and represent a uni que contribution of social cognitive theory (Bandura, \n1986). Evaluative reac tions involve students' beliefs about their progress. The belief that one is making \nacceptable progress toward a goal, along with the expected satisfaction of goal attainment, enh ances self-\nefficacy and sustains motivation (Schunk, 1996a). Nega tive evaluations will not decrease motivation if students \nbelieve they are capable of improving (e.g., by working harder or using more effective strategies). Motivation is \nnot en hanced if students think they lack the capability to succeed and that increased effort or better use of \nstrategies will not  help (Schunk, 1994). Self -reactions can be influenced by tangible self -rewards, which \nvalidate perceptions of progress and raise self -efficacy  when they are linked to actual accom plishments. For \nexample, students who believe they are im proving their study routine may reward themselves by taking a break \nto watch a movie.  \n \nThese three self -regulatory subprocesses interact with one another. As students observe their own performances, \nthey judge them against goal standards and react to those judgments. Their evaluations and reactions set the \nstage for additional observa tions. These subprocesses also interact with environmental fac tors (Zimmerman, \n1989). Students who judge their task progress as inadequate may react by requesting teacher assistance. Teach -\ners may help students learn a better strategy, which students then use to produce better learning. This dynamic \ninteraction of aspe cts of self -regulation is one of its central features (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994).  \n \nModeling Processes  \nModeling often is an antecedent of self -regulation. An impor tant contribution of social cognitive theory is to \nshow that modeling can serve different imitative functions: inhibi tion/disinhibition, response facilitation, and \nobservational learning (Bandura, 1986). Inhibition/disinhibition refers to the strengthening or weakening of \nbehavioral inhibitions that occurs as a res ult of observing models. For example, students who are afraid of math \nand observe models engage in math activities without negative consequences may experience less fear and try \nthe activities themselves (Zimmerman & Kind sler, 1979). Conversely, students who observe peers punished for \nclassroom misbehavior may be less likely to misbehave.  \n \nResponse facilitation occurs when modeled actions serve to socially prompt behavior by observers. New \nstudents in a class are likely to follow along and perform actions compa rable to those of classmates as a means \nof learning the rules and routines. Modeling even has been shown to induce greater creative fluency among \nobserving students (Zimmerman & Dialessi, 1973).  \n \nObservational learning through modeling occurs when observers display new behaviors that prior to modeling \nhad no probability of occurrence, even with motivational induce ments in effect (Bandura, 1986; Schunk, 1987; \nZimmerman & Rosenthal, 1974). To learn observationally, students must attend to a model, code the \ninformation for retention, be capable of producing the demonstrated responses, and be motivated to perform the \nmodeled behaviors (Bandura, 1986). An important form of ob servational learning occurs through cognitive "}
