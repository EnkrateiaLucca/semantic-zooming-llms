{"page": 5, "content": "modeling, which incorporates modeled explana tions and demonstrations with verbalizations of the model's \nthoughts and reasons for performing the actions (Meichen baum, 1977).  \n \nExposure to models is informative. Observer modeling is strongly affected by the functional value of behav - \nior\u2014whether modeled behaviors result in success or failure, reward or punishment. Modeled behaviors that lead \nto rewarding outcomes are more likely to be performed than behaviors that result in punishment (Zimmerman & \nKoussa, 1979).  \n \nModeled (vicarious) consequences also indicate the motivational value of behavior to observers (Bandura, \n1986). By observing modeled behaviors and their consequences, people formulate outcome  expectations about \nthe likely outcomes of actions. These expectations motivate behavior (Zimmerman, 1977).  \n \nPerceived similarity between model and observer is hypothesized to be an important source of information to \ndetermine behavioral appropriateness and formulate out come expectations (Schunk, 1987). Most social \nsituations are structured so that the appropriateness of behaviors depends on factors such as age, gender, or \nstatus. Although exceptions exist, the more a like observers are to models, the greater the probability that similar \nactions by observers are socially appropriate and will produce comparable re sults (Zimmerman & Koussa, \n1975). Similarity is espe cially influential when observers have little informati on about the functional value of \nbehaviors. This is not in tended to downplay the importance of diversity: People learn from models who are \nunlike themselves in many attributes. Societal norms are such, however, that similarity in critical attributes is \nhighly predictive of appropriateness for many behaviors (Bandura, 1986).  \n \nThe effects of modeled consequences on observers de pend in part on self -efficacy. Similarity to models consti -\ntutes an important source of vicarious information for gauging one's efficacy. Observing similar others succeed \ncan raise observers' efficacy and motivate them to try the task because they may believe that if others can \nsucceed they can as well. When similar others experience difficulty, observers may doubt th eir capabilities and \nmay not be motivated to try the task. Similarity can have profound effects in situations where individuals have \nexperienced difficulties and hold doubts about performing well (Schunk, 1987).  \n \nIn the current view, models are important so urces for conveying self -regulatory skills and for building their self -\nefficacy to employ these skills effectively on their own. The academic self -regulatory skills mentioned at the \noutset of this article are amenable to transmission by social models: pla nning and managing time; attending to \nand concentrating on instruction; organizing, rehearsing, and coding information strategically; establishing a \nproductive work environment; and using social resources. For example, students might ob serve a teacher \nengage in effective time management and verbalize appropriate principles. By observing models, stu dents may \nbelieve that they also can plan and manage time effectively, which creates a sense of self -efficacy for aca demic \nself-regulation a nd motivates students to engage in these activities.  \n \nSelf-Efficacy  \nSelf-efficacy is hypothesized to influence choice of tasks, effort expenditure, persistence, and achievement \n(Bandura, 1986, 1997; Schunk, 1996a; Zimmerman, 1995b). Compared with students who doubt their learning \ncapabilities, those with high self -efficacy for acquiring a skill or performing a task participate more readily, \nwork harder, persist longer when they encounter difficulties, and achieve at a higher level.  \n \nLearners ob tain information about their self -efficacy from their performance accomplishments, vicarious \n(observa tional) experiences, forms of persuasion, and physiological reactions. Students' own performances offer \nreliable guides for assessing self -efficacy. Succe sses raise efficacy and fail ures lower it (Zimmerman & Ringle, \n1981). Students socially acquire efficacy information by comparing their perform ances with those of others. \nSimilar others offer a valid basis for comparison (Schunk, 1987). Observing similar  peers suc ceed (or fail) at a \ntask may raise (or lower) observers' self -efficacy, The effects of such vicariously induced changes in self-\nefficacy can be negated by observers' subsequent per formance outcomes (e.g., observers fail to perform the task \nafter they view successful models).
